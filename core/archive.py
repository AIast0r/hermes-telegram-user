"""Archive operations: copy named chats down to SQLite, and search them offline.

Read-only towards Telegram like everything else in this plugin — the only RPC
here is ``client.get_messages``, which is history retrieval and acknowledges
nothing. No Read* RPC is ever called, so a sync leaves every unread badge in the
account exactly as it found it.

The sync is resumable and gap-aware. A walk pages newest→oldest; when it runs
out of budget before joining up with what is already on disk, the hole is
recorded in ``pending_from_id``/``pending_top_id`` and the ``newest`` watermark
does **not** move — advancing it across a gap would make the messages inside
unreachable forever. The next call closes the hole first and only then advances
the mark, and the marks are written even when an RPC fails mid-walk.
